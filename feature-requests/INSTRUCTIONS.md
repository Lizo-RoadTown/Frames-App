Helpful tips
- Prefer Git branches/PRs for code changes so we can review and test.
- For large files or binaries, include a README in the archive explaining target paths.
- Do NOT include secrets or credentials in this file.

When you're ready, paste your filled template here or add the file to `feature-requests/` and tell me the path/branch. I will apply patches and update the plan.
